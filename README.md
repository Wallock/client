## Introduction

This repository is an implementation of the [Laravel Breeze](https://laravel.com/docs/starter-kits) application / authentication starter kit frontend in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). All of the authentication boilerplate is already written for you - powered by [Laravel Sanctum](https://laravel.com/docs/sanctum), allowing you to quickly begin pairing your beautiful Next.js frontend with a powerful Laravel backend.

## Official Documentation

### Named Routes

For convenience, [Ziggy](https://github.com/tighten/ziggy#spas-or-separate-repos) may be used to reference your Laravel application's named route URLs from your React application.
